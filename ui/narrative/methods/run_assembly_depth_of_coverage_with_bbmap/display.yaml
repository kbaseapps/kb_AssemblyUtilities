            Reads Libraries from which to calculate DoC

description : |
    <p><b>Assembly Depth of Coverage with BBMap</b> allows the user calculate the Depth of Coverage over one or more Reads Libraries for one or more Data objects that contains an Assembly object.  Both the per-contig average DoC and overall average DoC for the whole assembly (has the most meaning for Genome objects) are calculated.</p>
